# MNIST Digit Recognition Optimiser Investigation

Code is created with reference to the following repositories:
1) https://github.com/ss-is-master-chief/MNIST-Digit.Recognizer-CNNs/blob/master/MNIST-Hand.Written.Digit.Recognition-CNN.ipynb

Use:
1) Installing Requirements
To set up the environment, create a virtual environment with Python 3.11.13 and install the required packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt

2) Dataset: This code uses the MNIST digit recognition dataset, retreving it from the internet through using the keras module, the data set is converted to adapt to Pytorch tensors
